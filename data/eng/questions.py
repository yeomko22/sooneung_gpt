W: Hello, Timberglade High School students. This is your P.E. teacher, Ms.
Larsen. I’d like to announce that we’re looking for volunteers to help with
the charity soccer match next month. As you know, our best players will
compete against our graduates at Ebanwood Stadium. Volunteers will show
the audience to their seats and tidy up after the match. All the money from
the ticket sales will get donated to the local children’s hospital. This will be
a great opportunity to get involved in helping children. Please don’t hesitate
to apply for this volunteer work at our charity soccer match. For more
information, you can check the school website. Thank you.

W: Hello, listeners. This is Dr. Graham’s One-minute Health Tips. Getting a
good night’s sleep is important for your health. But recently, more and more
people are experiencing trouble falling asleep. If that’s your case, wearing
an eye mask for sleeping can help you fall asleep. If your room doesn’t get
dark enough, it’ll be difficult to fall asleep. This is because light interferes
with the release of the hormone that makes you sleepy. An eye mask can
block the light, which makes it easier for you to fall asleep. Why not try one
tonight? I’ll be back with more tips next time!

Values alone do not create and build culture. Living your

right direction, but those behaviors must then be shared and
distributed widely throughout the organization, along with a

enough to simply talk about it. It is critical to have a visual
representation of the specific behaviors that leaders and all

help them perform well and win, your company should have a

Q. 밑줄 친 a nonstick frying pan이 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?

How you focus your attention plays a critical role in how
you deal with stress. Scattered attention harms your ability to let
go of stress, because even though your attention is scattered,
it is narrowly focused, for you are able to fixate only on the
stressful parts of your experience. When your attentional
spotlight is widened, you can more easily let go of stress. You
can put in perspective many more aspects of any situation and
not get locked into one part that ties you down to superficial
and anxiety-provoking levels of attention. A narrow focus
heightens the stress level of each experience, but a widened
focus turns down the stress level because you’re better able to put
each situation into a broader perspective. One anxiety-provoking
detail is less important than the bigger picture. It’s like
transforming yourself into a nonstick frying pan. You can still
fry an egg, but the egg won’t stick to the pan.

Being able to prioritize your responses allows you to connect
more deeply with individual customers, be it a one-off interaction
around a particularly delightful or upsetting experience, or the
development of a longer-term relationship with a significantly
influential individual within your customer base. If you’ve
ever posted a favorable comment ― or any comment, for that
matter ― about a brand, product or service, think about what it
would feel like if you were personally acknowledged by the
brand manager, for example, as a result. In general, people
post because they have something to say ― and because they
want to be recognized for having said it. In particular, when
people post positive comments they are expressions of
appreciation for the experience that led to the post. While a

Q. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?

Managers of natural resources typically face market
incentives that provide financial rewards for exploitation. For
example, owners of forest lands have a market incentive to cut
down trees rather than manage the forest for carbon capture,
wildlife habitat, flood protection, and other ecosystem services.
These services provide the owner with no financial benefits,
and thus are unlikely to influence management decisions. But
the economic benefits provided by these services, based on
their non-market values, may exceed the economic value of the
timber. For example, a United Nations initiative has estimated
that the economic benefits of ecosystem services provided by
tropical forests, including climate regulation, water purification,
and erosion prevention, are over three times greater per hectare
than the market benefits. Thus cutting down the trees is
economically inefficient, and markets are not sending the correct
“signal” to favor ecosystem services over extractive uses.

Q. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?

The concept of overtourism rests on a particular assumption
about people and places common in tourism studies and the
social sciences in general. Both are seen as clearly defined and
demarcated. People are framed as bounded social actors either
playing the role of hosts or guests. Places, in a similar way, are
treated as stable containers with clear boundaries. Hence,
places can be full of tourists and thus suffer from overtourism.
But what does it mean for a place to be full of people? Indeed,
there are examples of particular attractions that have limited
capacity and where there is actually no room for more visitors.
This is not least the case with some man-made constructions
such as the Eiffel Tower. However, with places such as cities,
regions or even whole countries being promoted as destinations
and described as victims of overtourism, things become more
complex. What is excessive or out of proportion is highly
relative and might be more related to other aspects than physical
capacity, such as natural degradation and economic leakages
(not to mention politics and local power dynamics).

Q. Charles H. Townes에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?

Charles H. Townes, one of the most influential American
physicists, was born in South Carolina. In his childhood, he
grew up on a farm, studying the stars in the sky. He earned his
doctoral degree from the California Institute of Technology in
1939, and then he took a job at Bell Labs in New York City.
After World War II, he became an associate professor of physics
at Columbia University. In 1958, Townes and his co-researcher
proposed the concept of the laser. Laser technology won quick
acceptance in industry and research. He received the Nobel
Prize in Physics in 1964. He was also involved in Project
Apollo, the moon landing project. His contribution is priceless
because the Internet and all digital media would be
unimaginable without the laser.

A number of studies provide substantial evidence of an

Over the last decade the attention given to how children
learn to read has foregrounded the nature of textuality, and of
the different, interrelated ways in which readers of all ages
make texts mean. ‘Reading’ now applies to a greater number of
representational forms than at any time in the past: pictures,
maps, screens, design graphics and photographs are all
regarded as text. In addition to the innovations made possible
in picture books by new printing processes, design features
also predominate in other kinds, such as books of poetry and
information texts. Thus, reading becomes a more complicated
kind of interpretation than it was when children’s attention
was focused on the printed text, with sketches or pictures as an
adjunct. Children now learn from a picture book that words
and illustrations complement and enhance each other. Reading
is not simply ____________________. Even in the easiest

A musical score within any film can add an additional layer
to the film text, which goes beyond simply imitating the action
viewed. In films that tell of futuristic worlds, composers, much
like sound designers, have added freedom to create a world that
is unknown and new to the viewer. However, unlike sound
designers, composers often shy away from creating unique
pieces that reflect these new worlds and often present musical
scores that possess familiar structures and cadences. While it is
possible that this may interfere with creativity and a sense of

Through recognizable scores, visions of the future or a galaxy

There have been psychological studies in which subjects

Everyone who drives, walks, or swipes a transit card in a

_____________________________________. That’s
why we find so many well-intentioned and civic-minded
citizens arguing past one another. At neighborhood meetings

churches, local residents across the nation gather for
often-contentious discussions about transportation proposals

transportation is local and intensely personal. A transit project
that could speed travel for tens of thousands of people can be
stopped by objections to the loss of a few parking spaces or by
the simple fear that the project won’t work. It’s not a challenge

Speaking fast is a high-risk proposition. It’s nearly impossible

Negotiation can be defined as an attempt to explore and
reconcile conflicting positions in order to reach an
acceptable outcome.

(A) Areas of difference can and do frequently remain, and
will perhaps be the subject of future negotiations, or
indeed remain irreconcilable. In those instances in which
the parties have highly antagonistic or polarised relations,
the process is likely to be dominated by the exposition,
very often in public, of the areas of conflict.
(B) In these and sometimes other forms of negotiation,
negotiation serves functions other than reconciling
conflicting interests. These will include delay, publicity,
diverting attention or seeking intelligence about the other
party and its negotiating position.
(C) Whatever the nature of the outcome, which may actually
favour one party more than another, the purpose of
negotiation is the identification of areas of common interest
and conflict. In this sense, depending on the intentions of
the parties, the areas of common interest may be clarified,
refined and given negotiated form and substance.

Science is sometimes described as a winner-take-all contest,

that it suggests that only a handful of contests exist. ( ③ ) But
many other contests have multiple parts, and the number of
such contests may be increasing. ( ④ ) By way of example,

Even those with average talent can produce notable work
in the various sciences, so long as they do not try to embrace
all of them at once. Instead, they should concentrate attention
on one subject after another (that is, in different periods of
time), although later work will weaken earlier attainments
in the other spheres. This amounts to saying that the brain
adapts to universal science in time but not in space. In fact,
even those with great abilities proceed in this way. Thus,
when we are astonished by someone with publications in
different scientific fields, realize that each topic was
explored during a specific period of time. Knowledge
gained earlier certainly will not have disappeared from the
